\section{Conclusion}
We propose a secure state estimator for two classes of nonlinear dynamical systems. We then focus on the wide area control of power systems, and develop an estimator for dynamic states in power systems under cyber-physical attacks and communication failures. Finally, we numerically show that the performance of the cyber layer in power systems can be significantly improved by using our estimator. One possible direction for future research is reducing the computational complexity of the secure state estimators. Note that the computational complexity increases with the time index. Therefore, computing an exact solution to the $l_1$-minimization problem in a recursive way can significantly reduce the time required to obtain a new estimate.
