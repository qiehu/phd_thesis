\section{Nonlinear Secure Estimation \label{sec:nonlinear_se}}
%\begin{abstract}
%\textcolor{black}{We focus on securely estimating the state of a nonlinear dynamical system from a set of corrupted measurements for two classes of nonlinear systems, and propose a technique which enables us to perform secure state estimation for those systems. We then illustrate how the proposed nonlinear secure state estimation technique \textcolor{black}{can be used to perform estimation} in the cyber layer of interconnected power systems under cyber-physical attacks and communication failures. In particular, we focus on an interconnected power system comprising several synchronous generators, transmission lines, loads, and energy storage units, and propose a secure estimator that allows us to securely estimate the dynamic states of the power network. Finally, we numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed secure estimation algorithm, and show that the algorithm enables the cyber layer to accurately reconstruct the attack signals.}

%\section{Error Correction: A Review}\label{sec:review}
%
%\textcolor{red}{May not be needed as it repeats what's in the linear SE section.}
%
%\subsection{Classical Error Correction}
%\textbf{Compressed Sensing:} Sparse solutions $x\in \mathbb{R}^n$, are sought to the following problem:
%\begin{equation}
%	\min_x %\norm{x}_0 \text{ subject to } b= Ax
%	\label{eq:CS}
%\end{equation}
%where $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$ are the measurements, and $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}~ (m \ll n)$ is a sensing matrix. 
%%$\norm{x}_0$ 
%denotes the number of nonzero elements of $x$. The following lemma provides a sufficient condition for a unique solution to (\ref{eq:CS}).
%
%%\textcolor{black}{in II.A., you reference [16] right before Lemma 1 and [18] inside Lemma 1.  This is confusing.  If you are referencing the form of Lemma 1 from [16] that is presented in [18] then you should be explicit about it.}
%%\textcolor{black}{I removed [18] here, but we cite it later in IIB before equation (5).}
%\begin{lem} (\hspace{1sp}\cite{Candes_Tao}) \label{lem:CS}
%If the sparsest solution to (\ref{eq:CS}) has $\norm{x}_0 = q$ and $m\ge 2q$ and all subsets of $2q$ columns of $A$ are full rank, then the solution is unique.
%\end{lem}
%\begin{pf}
%Suppose the solution is not unique. Therefore, there exists $x_1 \neq  x_2$ such that $Ax _1 = b$ and $Ax_2 = b$ where $\norm{x_1}_0 = \norm{x_2}_0 = q$. Then, $A(x_1 - x_2) = 0$ and $x_1 - x_2 \neq 0$. Since $\norm{x_1-x_2}_0 \leq 2q$ and all $2q$ columns of $A$ are full rank (i.e. linearly independent), it is impossible to have $x_1-x_2\neq 0$ that satisfies $A(x_1-x_2) = 0$. This contradicts the assumption.
%\end{pf}\qed
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\textbf{The Error Correction Problem \cite{Candes_Tao}:} %\label{sec:error_correction}
%Consider the classical error correction problem: $y=Cx + e$ where $C\in \mathbb{R}^{l\times n}$ is a coding matrix $(l > n)$ and assumed to be full rank. We wish to recover the input vector $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ from corrupted measurements $y$. Here, $e$ is an arbitrary and unknown sparse error vector. To reconstruct $x$, note that it is obviously sufficient to reconstruct the vector $e$ since knowledge of $Cx + e$ together with $e$ gives $Cx$, and consequently $x$ since $C$ has full rank \cite{Candes_Tao}. In \cite{Candes_Tao}, the authors construct a matrix $F$ which annihilates $C$ on the left, i.e.,  $FCx = 0$ for all $x$. Then, they apply $F$ to the output $y$ and obtain
%\begin{equation}
%	\tilde y = F (Cx + e) = Fe.
%\end{equation}
%Thus, the decoding problem can be reduced to that of reconstructing a sparse vector $e$ from the observations $\tilde y = Fe$. Therefore, by Lemma \ref{lem:CS}, if all subsets of $2q$ columns of $F$ are full rank, then we can reconstruct any $e$ such that $\| e \|_0 \leq q$.
%%We refer to a decoder that can correct $q$ errors as a $q$-error-correcting decoder.
%
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Secure Estimation for Linear Dynamical Systems \cite{David_Chang2} }
%
%%\textcolor{black}{II.B. seems like it should reference [11] -- is this the exact formulation in [11] or is it changed to suit the development here?  In any case, be explicit about this.}
%
%Consider the linear control system as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%&x(k+1)= A x(k) ,\\
%&y(k) = C x(k) + e(k)
%\end{aligned}
% \label{eq:system_model_se}
%\end{equation}
%where $x(k) \in \mathbb{R}^n $ and  $y(k) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represent the states and outputs of the system at time $k$, respectively. $e(k) \in \mathbb{R}^p$ represents attack signals injected by malicious agents at the sensors, and the set of attacked sensors can change over time.
%
%Consider the problem of reconstructing the initial state $x(0)$ of the plant from the corrupted observations $y(k)$'s where $k=0,...,T-1$.
%Let $E_{q,T}$ denote the set of error vectors $\begin{bmatrix} e(0); ~ ...~  ;  e(T-1) \end{bmatrix}   \in  \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T} $ where each $e(k)$ satisfies $\|e(k)\|_0 \leq q \leq p$. %$\lvert \textsf{supp}(e(k)) \rvert \le q \le p $.
%\begin{eqnarray} \label{eq:sys_err_corr}
%\begin{aligned}
%	Y &\triangleq \begin{bmatrix} y(0) \\ y(1) \\ \vdots \\ y(T-1) \end{bmatrix}
%		= \begin{bmatrix} Cx(0) + e(0)\\ CA x(0) + e(1) \\ \vdots \\ CA^{T-1} x(0) + e(T-1) \end{bmatrix} \\
%		& =
%		\begin{bmatrix} C \\ CA \\ \vdots \\ CA^{T-1} \end{bmatrix} x(0) + E_{q,T} \triangleq \Phi x(0) + E_{q,T}
%		\label{eq:decoder_Phi}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $Y \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T}$ is a collection of corrupted measurements over $T$ time steps and $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T \times n}$. \textcolor{black}{We call $\Phi$ the $T$-step observability matrix of the system.} %\st{ if $B=0$ (i.e., $A = A_o$)}. \st{Since we consider secure estimation of adversarial attacks,}
%Here, we need to assume that $\operatorname{rank}(\Phi) = n$; otherwise, the system is unobservable and we cannot determine $x(0)$ even if there was no attack (i.e., $E_{q,T} = 0$).
%
%
%Inspired by the error correction techniques proposed in \cite{Candes_Tao} and \cite{David_Chang2}, we first determine the error vector $E_{q,T}$, and then solve for $x(0)$. %[We say this upfront, so readers know what to expect, and it may be less surprising when they see the second method?]  \st{We consider the error correction approach.}
%Consider the $QR$ decomposition of $\Phi \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T \times n}$,
%\begin{eqnarray}
%	\Phi = \begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & Q_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} R_1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = Q_1 R_1
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & Q_2 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T \times p\cdot T}$ is orthogonal, $Q_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T\times n}, Q_2 \in \mathbb{R}^{p\cdot T \times (p\cdot T-n)}$, and $R_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ is a rank-$n$ upper triangular matrix.
%Pre-multiplying (\ref{eq:decoder_Phi}) by $\begin{bmatrix} Q_1 & Q_2 \end{bmatrix} ^\top$ gives:
%\begin{equation}
%	\begin{bmatrix} Q_1 ^\top \\ Q_2 ^\top \end{bmatrix} Y = \begin{bmatrix}R_1 \\ 0  \end{bmatrix} x(0) + \begin{bmatrix} Q_1 ^\top \\ Q_2^\top \end{bmatrix} E_{q,T}.
%	\label{eq:QR}
%\end{equation}
%We can compute $E_{q,T}$ by using the second block row:
%\begin{equation}
%	\tilde Y \triangleq Q_2^\top Y = Q_2^\top E_{q,T}
%	\label{eq:E_est}
%\end{equation}
%where $Q_2^\top \in \mathbb {R} ^{ (p\cdot T-n) \times p\cdot T}$.
%\textcolor{black}{From Lemma \ref{lem:CS}, (\ref{eq:E_est}) has a unique, $s$-sparse solution (where $s\le q\cdot T$) if all subsets of $2s$ columns (at most $2 q\cdot T$ columns) of $Q_2^\top$ are full rank. Therefore, we consider solving the following $l_1$-minimization problem:}
%\begin{equation}
%	\hat{E}_{q,T} = \arg \min_E \norm { E}_{l_1} \text{ subject to } \tilde Y = Q_2^\top E
%	\label{eq:solve_E}
%\end{equation}
%\textcolor{black}{Note that the $l_0$-minimization problem can be approximated by an $l_1$-minimization problem to give a convex decoder that is computationally feasible. Motivated by the problem of finding sparse decompositions of special signals in the field of mathematical signal processing, a series of studies \cite{tao11}-\!\cite{Tropp11} showed exact equivalence between the two programs $l_0$ and $l_1$ when the Restricted Isometry Property conditions are satisfied. For more information on the equivalence between the $l_1$-minimization problem and the $l_0$-minimization problem, we refer the reader to \cite{tao11}-\!\cite{Tropp11}.}
%
%
%
%
%%Clearly, this is a reasonable assumption if $(p\cdot T-n) \ge 2q\cdot T$.
%
%Now, given the vector $\hat{E}_{q,T}$, we can compute $x(0)$ from the first block row of (\ref{eq:QR}) as follows:
%\begin{equation}
%	x(0) = R_1^{-1} Q_1^\top (Y- \hat{E}_{q,T})
%	\label{eq:QR1}
%\end{equation}
%The following lemma provides the conditions under which the solution to (\ref{eq:QR1}) exists and is unique.
%%\textcolor{black}{Specifically, does Lemma 2 need a citation?} \textcolor{green}{I think we need a citation here}\textcolor{black}{This is a result proved in [11], is it OK to just cite [11] or do we need any other citations?}
%\begin{lem} \label{lem:EC}
%	$x(0) $ is the unique solution if all subsets of $2s$ columns of $Q_2 ^\top$ are linearly independent and $\Phi$ is full column rank. %Also, this condition is equivalent to $\| \Phi z \|_0 > 2s$ %$\lvert \textsf{supp}( \Phi z) \rvert > 2 s = 2 (q\cdot T)$
%%for all $z \in \mathbb{R}^n \backslash \{ 0 \}$.
%\end{lem}
%\begin{pf}
%By Lemma \ref{lem:CS} and noting that by definition the null space of $Q_2^\top$ equals the column space of $\Phi$. %For the second statement, we would like to show that the following are equivalent: \\

\section{Conclusion}
\textcolor{black}{We propose a secure state estimator for two classes of nonlinear dynamical systems. We then focus on the wide area control of power systems, and develop an estimator for dynamic states in power systems under cyber-physical attacks and communication failures. Finally, we numerically show that the performance of the cyber layer in power systems can be significantly improved by using our estimator.} \textcolor{black}{One possible direction for future research is reducing the computational complexity of the secure state estimators. Note that the computational complexity increases with the time index. Therefore, computing an exact solution to the $l_1$-minimization problem in a recursive way can significantly reduce the time required to obtain a new estimate.}
