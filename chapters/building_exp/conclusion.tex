\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this chapter, we demonstrate experimentally that commercial buildings equipped with VAV HVAC systems can provide frequency regulation, by varying the power consumption of the supply fans.
To do so, we improve on existing frequency regulation control algorithms and propose a two-level control scheme that is suitable even for buildings subjected to larger disturbances and/or modeling uncertainties.
Then, we demonstrate our controller's performance through numerous field experiments conducted in an occupied commercial building, using archived PJM frequency regulation signals.
