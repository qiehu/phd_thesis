%Increased penetration of renewable energy sources has increased the demand for frequency regulation reserves.
%In this paper, we demonstrate experimentally that commercial buildings equipped with variable air volume heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems can provide frequency regulation. 
%%More specifically, by adjusting the electricity consumption of the supply fans of the HVAC system. 
%A main challenge in this application is that commercial buildings and their HVAC systems are often complex and subject to large disturbances such as occupancy.
%Here, we describe a data-driven method to identify a model that describes the building's thermal dynamics and captures such disturbances.
%In addition, we propose a control scheme that adjusts the electricity consumption of the supply fans of the HVAC system to track the frequency regulation signal, and is suitable for scenarios where an accurate fan model is unavailable. %, e.g. buildings with large uncertainties. 
%We demonstrate the performance of our proposed control scheme through numerous field experiments conducted in an occupied commercial building, and in accordance with PJM's regulation market rules.
